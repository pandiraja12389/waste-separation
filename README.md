# waste-separation
INTRODUCTION:

India’s garbage generation stands at 0.2 to 0.6 kilograms of garbage per head per day. Segregation at source is crucial for clean cities. India’s per capita waste generation is so high, that it creates a crisis if the garbage collector doesn’t visit a neighbourhood for a couple of days. Improper waste disposal 
causes problems that cause degradation of the environment.
Waste has been piling up in many dumping grounds all over India. Most of this waste is in mixed form and hence cannot be disposed off effectively. The most commonly used waste handling techniques are burning of waste or using it as landfill.The waste is not subjected to recycling, composting, or any other form of environmental treatment. Hazardous toxic wastes lie side by side with the organic wastes in the landfill. 

It should be imperative on the part of municipalities to separate the biodegradable from non-biodegradable waste. Biodegradable wastes can then be subjected to composting. Wastes like plastic, metal, paper etc can also be subjected to recycling. In some ways, the waste can actually serve as a resource. By separating waste into different categories we can implement processes that will lead to effective resource utilization. This could be implemented at individual as well as society level.

PROPOSED SOLUTION:

The proposed system makes use of sensors to identify incoming objects. Inductive sensors are used to detect metallic objects. Capacitive sensors are used to detect plastics and glass and disposable objects. They are adjusted to sense only disposable objects. Ultrasonic sensors are used to detect the presence of non-transparent objects within the system. Arduino MEGA microcontroller is used to process the outputs from the sensors. Based on sensor outputs, the microcontroller provides control signals in the form of steps to a stepper motor. Depending on the number of steps the motor rotates by a specific angle and aligns itself below the sensing plate. After that the object is dropped into its corresponding bin. Hence plastics and metals will be separated from disposable objects.
